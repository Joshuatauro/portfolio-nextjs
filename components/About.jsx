        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">Hi, i'm Joshua, an aspiring SWE who loves to spend his free time learning new technologies and build stuff using said technologies. I was born in India, but did the better part of education in Dubai, although I will be doing my undergrad in India. <br /> <br /> I started learning Web Development during the pandemic in 2020 (ðŸ˜·) as something to take my mind off the surrounding, little did i know that it would go on to become something I am VERY passionate about.ðŸ’˜
        <br /> <br />
        Even after so much time, I am always surprised by how much there is to learn, and this motivates me even more ðŸ’¯ , I mainly work on the Web, but recently have been trying out Game Development and App Development
